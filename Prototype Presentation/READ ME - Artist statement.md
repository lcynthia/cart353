"City Night Light" is an interactive interface that allows the viewer to play with the levels of luminosity in a fictional city. 
Increasing the city lights will create a shield over the city disabling the viewer to see the sky. Decreasing them will, on the other side,
reveal the natural sources of light of the sky and allow the person to witness astral activities. The realisation of this platform engages 
the common citizen by introducing new possibilities for light sources in an urban context; also, it will hopefully bring them to question 
the necessity for the enormous amount of artificial light in cities. Two opposite universes will constitute the experience of this 
interface: the noisy ground level of city life and the meditative spectacle of space. The environment in which the viewer will have the 
experience (i.e. the buildings, the streets) will be designed to be sensitive to the external surroundings in which the person is 
physically, thus bringing to the foreground the ongoing impact and dialogue the citizen has with its urban milieu. That impact will be 
showcased whether the subject finds themselves in the noise city level or looking at the sky unveiled. The ground (and buildings) will 
react according to the sound input it will be fed with, coming from the external space in which the viewer is situated. When city lights 
are at low level, the sky's motion and luminance will be influenced by the input taken from the computer's camera. City Night Light
engages urban design with an experience-based approach rather than a visual spatial one.
