"City Night Light" is an interactive interface that allows the viewer to play with the levels of luminosity in a fictional city. 
Increasing the city lights will create a shield over the city disabling the viewer to see the sky. Decreasing them will, on the other side,
reveal the natural sources of light of the sky and allow the person to witness astral activities. The realisation of this platform engages 
the common citizen by introducing new possibilities for light sources in an urban context; also, it will hopefully bring them to question 
the necessity for the enormous amount of artificial light in cities. Two opposite universes will constitute the experience of this 
interface: the noisy ground level of city life and the meditative spectacle of space. The environment in which the viewer will have the 
experience (i.e. the buildings, the streets) will be designed to be sensitive to the external surroundings in which the person is 
physically, thus bringing to the foreground the ongoing impact and dialogue the citizen has with its urban milieu.
