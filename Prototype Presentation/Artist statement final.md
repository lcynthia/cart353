"City Night Light" is an [interactive] interface that allows the viewer to play with the levels of luminosity in a fictional city. 
Increasing the city lights will create a shield over the city disabling the viewer to see the sky. Decreasing them will, on the other 
side, reveal the natural sources of light of the sky and allow the person to witness a star-filled sky ( with potentially astral 
activities). The realization of this platform engages the common citizen by introducing new possibilities for light sources in an urban 
context; also, it will hopefully bring them to question the necessity for the enormous amount of artificial light in cities. City Night 
Light engages urban design with an experience-based approach rather than a visual spatial one. Originally, sound was supposed to be 
incorporated in the project but because of technical problems and lack of time, it has been withdrawn. The environment in which the viewer 
will have the experience (i.e. the buildings, the streets) was at first thought to be sensitive to the external surroundings in which the 
person is physically, thus bringing to the foreground the ongoing impact and dialogue the citizen has with its urban milieu. That impact 
would have been showcased whether the subject finds themselves in the noise city level or looking at the sky unveiled in the following 
way: the ground reacts according to the sound input it will be fed with, coming from the external space in which the viewer is situated. 
When city lights are at low level, the brightness level taken from the computer's camera influences the sky's motion and luminance. 
However, while executing the project with the code, Processing crashed often since it is not a software efficient with 3D spaces. 
In this manner, a lot of elements departed from the interface from the software's lack of resources. An attempt to compose the sky out 
of meshes revealed itself unsuccessful because the program would run three times slower just with the implementation of one mesh in the 
sky. Also, when importing the video library to detect brightness from the camera, the software crashed after it runs for two seconds, 
apparently having difficulty to manage both 3D space and video in the same program. Experiencing those issues resulted in the removal of 
the responsive aspect of the project, not reflecting anymore the sensitivity of the city expressed in the conceptualization.
