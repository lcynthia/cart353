8 - 
City landscape where you could switch off the city lights and gradually see the astral spectacle. When switching lights back on, 
you would see less the stars. The view would be from the user's standpoint, who would virtually be at street level. With some commands,
the user will be able to fluctuate the city lights (street lamps, buildings etc.) to either see more or less of the sky.

14 - Landscape of a bedroom with many electronic devices emitting waves, visuals would show how waves are disrupting one's 
sleep. Could be done in VR, or for cellphones using its camera

25 - Visual support for timer (e.g. a hourglass), aesthetically beautiful to make the idea of a timer less dry and motivate you to use 
it more often
