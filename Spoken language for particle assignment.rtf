MainParticle:\
Responsible for general particle structure. Parent\
Common function structure like display, update, apply force\
\
Bubbles:\
Subclass of MainParticle. Child \
Location spread out in Water\
Forces applied to bubbles like pressure and release of gravity\
Bubbles oscillating \
\
Food:\

\cf0 Subclass of MainParticle. Child \
Location starting on top of canvas and falling in water in groups of like 20\
While not in water, forces such as wind applied on food\
When in Water, forces such as drag (and some oscillation force) applied\
	food looses opacity as it dissolves in water\
When no opacity, delete food from arraylist\
\
Rock:\
Subclass of MainParticle. Child \
Location starting on top of canvas and falling in water in groups of like 5\
Gravity applied from the top, Drag when in Water\
Go to end of canvas, and when there stay there (rocks at bottom)\
Forces applied as quake making rocks move\
\
Organism (optional):\
Subclass of MainParticle. Child \
Location spread out in middle of Water\
Forces like acceleration making organism move in Water\
The longer organism not in contact with food, the darker it becomes\
When dead, drops at bottom of water and desintegrates with decrease of opacity}
