Different cityscapes with products and services of everyday life, that would inform you of their impacts on (y)our life

Roots: the etymology of words used by young people and found in slangs. Could be done with words found in pop songs for example, the song would be playing maybe

A room with basic furniture that you would have to clean regurlarly, and the furnitures would gradually get dirty and would need cleaning every week (or every other number of time)

Interactive experience of you selecting drinks (from water to cola to alcohol) and you would see how it alters the visuals on the screen (as if it was your eyes)

A soundscape of a place in the city illustrating the amount of noise we are exposed to daily, and you would be able to "clean" the sound by removing different elements and modifying parameters (like volume) until optimal sound stimuli
